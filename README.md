# Vitruvius Modeling UI

This project provides a modern, interactive modeling user interface for the [Vitruvius Framework](https://github.com/vitruv-framework), enabling users to:

- Visually create and edit models using a drag-and-drop editor
- Automatically synchronize changes across heterogeneous models (e.g., UML and Java)
- Perform real-time consistency checks and validations
- Integrate seamlessly with EMF-based backends and the Vitruvius infrastructure

## Features

✅ Graphical model editing  
✅ Model synchronization via change propagation  
✅ Live validation of consistency rules  
✅ EMF and Ecore compatibility  
✅ Built on Eclipse Theia for web-based extensibility  

## Technologies

- **Vitruvius Framework**
- **Eclipse Modeling Framework (EMF)**
- **Eclipse Theia / VS Code Extensions**
